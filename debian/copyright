Comment: In the original debian/copyright file Ianaré Sévi wrote this:
 "Icons are released under different licenses, check icon_license.txt."
 .
 Icons from Barbara Kämper are stated as being GPL (no version given).
 .
 The work of Paul Davey is licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA and on his site
 (http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/37966044/) he links to the 3.0
 license, but then quotes 2.5 in the written text (so choosing 2.5 as
 this is based on his actual personal statements, rather than a link).
 .
 It is unknown which icons are from which source, hence this comment.
 .
 See src/icons/icon_license.txt for further details from Ianaré Sévi.
