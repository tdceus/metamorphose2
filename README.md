Métamorphose 2
==============

NOTE ON Python3/wxPython4 BETA VERSION
--------------------------------------

> Due the creator of Métamorphose Ianaré Sévi no longer having time to
> maintain it, and the end of life of Python 2 and wxPython2/3, this 
> forked version has been created to enable it's continued use in the
> future. Huge thanks to Ianaré for writing the software and maintaining 
> it while he had time!
>
> This branch is for use with Python 3 and wxPython 4 only. It is not
> compatible with earlier versions of Python or wxPython. I am sharing
> it here in the hope that it may be of use to others who can continue to
> gain as much use out of this as I do.
> 
> There are no functional changes in this version.  The only changes are 
> to make it work with the libraries, to reflect new submodule versions 
> and changes to the translation system with the deprecation of the python 
> specific utilities, so while I am hoping that it continues to work on
> Windows and Mac, I can only test it only on Debian Bullesye.

Métamorphose is a graphical mass renaming program for files and folders.

These are the command line options:

    -h,  --help       Show help screen and exit.
    -t,  --timer      Show time taken to complete operations.
    -d,  --debug      Show debugging information.
    -p=, --path       Specify a directory to load.
    -c=, --config     Specify a configuration file to load.
    -a=, --auto       Specify automatic mode level to use with configuration file:
                        0 = do not preview items
                        1 = auto preview items
                        2 = auto rename items
                        3 = auto rename items and exit on success
    -l=, --language   Override preferred language:
                        en_US
                        fr
                        es

If no other options are given, you may specify a path to open:

    $ metamorphose2 /srv/samba/Windows Likes Spaces

Running from Source
-------------------

What follows is for developers or those wishing to use the very latest
version.

For binary (normal) installs, use the appropriate install file for your
system (setup.exe, .deb, etc \...).

### Cloning

Cloning the sources from the remote:

    git clone -b Python3_WXPython4 https://github.com/timinaust/metamorphose2.git

Submodules are used, so after cloning don\'t forget to check them out:

    git submodule update --init

### Requirements

-   Python 3 (**\* not compatible with 2.**\*)
-   wxPython 4 (**\* not compatible with 2 or 3**\*)
-   Python Imaging Library Pillow 2.3.0 or greater

### Running

Create or update the language files:

    ./generate_pot.sh

Launch the application:

    ./metamorphose2

### Installing

As root:

    make all

Under Linux & freeBSD The makefile should take care of everything for
you, it is architecture and distro independant.

Métamorphose will be installed in `/usr/share/metamorphose2`, you can
run it with:

    metamorphose2

and access the man page with:

    man metamorphose2

If you are using a freedesktop.org compatible window manager (like Gnome
or KDE), there should be an entry in `Applications` -\> `Accessories`.

### Removing

Remove the user-specific files here:

-   Windows:
    `C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\.metamorphose2`
-   Linux/BSD: `~/.metamorphose2`
-   Mac: `/Library/Application Support/.metamorphose2`

In Linux & BSD, if you have the sources:

    make remove

To remove all user files as well:

    make remove remusr=1

Known Issues
------------

Program locks up when \'walking\' a large number of files/folders

> Not really locked up, but the time it takes to process entries can be
> long if you are loading many items. During this process the
> application doesn\'t refresh, giving the appearance of being locked up
> but is actually working on stuff.
>
> The time in this state is dependent on your computer, whether the
> directory is on a local drive or a network share, and of course the
> number of items.
>
> This will be addressed in a future release.

Unreadable picker items under Linux (possibly other GTK)

> There seems to be a bug in wxGTK, the list can become slow and
> unreadable when dealing with large number of items (over 10 000).
>
> A work around may be possible.

Thumbnails fail

> There seems to be some problems with python-imaging under windows.
> Sometimes the image will not load.
